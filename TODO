* implement multi-axis, i.e. numpy 1D array with named fields, which would allow to address axes by names such as
date.year or date.day

* implement cube.overlay(cube)

* add performance tests and benchmarks

* add tests for free functions such as nc.reduce or nc.apply

* add pretty print

* group_by where axis is Index does not make sense -> shortcut...

* reverse(axis)

* implement roll, accumulate, nonzero, filled, argmax, where, choose

* tests for first, last, reversed

* explain and test comparisons with NaNs

* add more math functions such as exp, log, etc.
