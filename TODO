* implement multiaxis, i.e. numpy 1D array with named fields, which would allow to address axes by names such as
date.year or date.day

* implement cube.overlay(cube)

* implement cube.filter(cube)

* implement cube.filter(axes)

* add more operations

* add performance tests

* add tests and benchmarks for free functions such as nc.reduce or nc.apply

* add pretty print

* group_by where axis is Index does not make sense -> shortcut...
